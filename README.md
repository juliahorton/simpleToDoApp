# simpleToDoApp

This to-do list was created as part of a JavaScript exercise in Springboard's Software Engineering Career Track program. The assignment instructions were: 

Part 1: Build a to-do app. As a user, you should be able to add a new to-do (by submitting a form), mark a to-do as completed (cross out the text of the to-do), and remove a todo.

Part 2: Now that you have a functioning to-do app, make sure that when the page refreshes, the to-dos on the page remain there.

Instructions for using the app: 

Double-click on a task to mark it as important. 

Single click on a task to strike it through. 

Single click on the 'remove' button next to a task to remove it from the list.
